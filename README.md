### WELCOME to QUAKE 2: PSYCHIC POWERS.

This mod features 5 movement abilities, 5 utility abilities, updated weapons that inflict psychic statuses on enemies, and the ability to view your enemies' thoughts.


### INSTALLATION

Simply place the coolermod folder, containing gamex86.dll, into your Quake 2 install. Launch the game with the arguments "+set game coolermod"

### WEAPON CHANGES:

## Blaster:
Fires a set of low-damage blaster bolts in an X. If an enemy gets hit, inflicts Doomed.

## Shotgun:
Fires an extra-wide low-damage shockwave spread. On a hit, inflicts antigrav.

## Super Shotgun:
...Does too much.

## Machinegun:
Erases enemies from the timeline on hit.

## Chaingun:
Does that too, but the force of faster firing pushes the player backwards... really, really fast.

## Grenade Launcher:
Fires a floating ghost forward that explodes on hit or on a timer, like a grenade. On hit, inflicts Warp Sickness.

## Rocket Launcher:
Fires a 9x9 spread of rockets that also inflict Warp Sickness.

## HyperBlaster:
Creates an invisible aura of death around the player. ...It also inflicts Warp Sickness. I like Warp Sickness, okay??

## Railgun:
Permanently stuns enemies on hit and gives the player 500 Psychic Power.

## BFG10K:
Travels much faster now. The extra lightning bolts inflict Headache.

## Hand Grenade:
Fires 3 exploding ghosts... But they're too heavy to float. Sorry.


### PSYCHIC VISION:
Press the V key to enable PSYCHIC VISION. When close to an enemy, aim roughly towards them to view their thoughts, including name, health, and current state! You can also view the thoughts of damageable inanimate objects... They don't do much, but maybe it's helpful. The console command is psychicvision.
